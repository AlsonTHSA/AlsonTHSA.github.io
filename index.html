  I am currerntly serving my nation service, i enlisted on 1st October so its been about 2 and a half months into my service. My BMT experience was definitely a tough one as i have to be away from home for about a week before i am able to go back for a few days which was the most difficult part of my BMT journey. However, serving Nation Service is mandatory for every Singaporean men, so in a way i am proud that i am able to keep up with what majority of Singaporean men has done. However, i can't help but feel sad that i am not able to pursue what i want to do in life and have to be pushed behind 2 years before i can really get my life started. This concludes what i have to share about my NSF experience for the time being, more details about ways to contact me will be shared below!
